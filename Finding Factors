#GOAL
#Define a function that creates a list of all the numbers that are factors of the user's number. For example, if the function is called factor, factor(36) should return [1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36]. The numbers in your list should be from least to greatest, and 1 and the original number should be included.

def factors(number):
    results = [];
    for i in range(1, number+1):
        if number % i == 0:
		 results.append(i)
        else:
            print "doing next number %d" % (i)
    print results
      
factors(36)
